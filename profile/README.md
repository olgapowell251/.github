# Hi there, I’m a passionate developer!

I'm an experienced software developer with a strong background in building scalable web applications and robust backend systems. My expertise lies in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, making me a versatile asset to any team. 

I have a deep understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C#, and I love working with frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js. My backend experience includes utilizing Express, Django, and ASP.NET to create RESTful APIs and microservices.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and leverage best practices like TDD and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to deliver high-quality software. I’m passionate about Agile methodologies and thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to team success. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and diving into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
